21. multi_comet {"r","g","b","r2","g2","b2","tail":3-30,"count1":1-8,"count2":0-8,"gap":5-50,"bounce":false} Multiple comets! count1=forward color1, count2=backward color2. gap=spacing.
22. zone_effect {"r","g","b","r2","g2","b2","center":0-700,"radius":1-100,"sub":"expand/breathing/comet/fill/twinkle","tail":3-30,"density":5-30,"freq":0.2-3.0} Effect in specific ZONE.

CRITICAL RULES:
- "multiple snakes" or "several comets" or "group" = "multi_comet"
- "3 red forward, 2 blue backward" = multi_comet count1:3,count2:2
- "effect on specific LEDs" or "at position X" = "zone_effect"
- "twinkling","flickering","smooth on/off" = "twinkle" mode:0
- "sharp twinkle" or "instant flash" = twinkle mode:1
- "strobe twinkle" = twinkle mode:2
- "twinkle on background" = twinkle with bg + bgr,bgg,bgb for background color
- "twinkle 3 colors" = twinkle colors:3 with r,g,b + r2,g2,b2 + r3,g3,b3
- "snake forward one color, back another" = "ping_pong"
- sparkle=SHARP. twinkle=configurable(mode 0-3). comet=ONE. multi_comet=MULTIPLE.
- dual_comet=exactly 2 opposite. multi_comet=any number any direction.
- "no gradient" or "same brightness" or "solid snake" = comet with solid:true
- tail/seg/width = number of LEDs. ONLY JSON. No markdown.
- Not LED: {"name":"ERROR","algorithm":"none","params":{},"error":"not_effect"}
